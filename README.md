# Property Cross

<img align="right" width="400px" src="https://www.codenameone.com/img/property-cross.png" alt="Property Cross">

This demo is based on the [Property Cross](https://github.com/tastejs/PropertyCross) project which aims to compare the differences between various cross platform solutions. It demonstrates how unlike other solutions Codename One maintains a single code base to produce native applications.

The demo is a simple yet common application type that deals with webservices, infinite lists, image thumbnails, search, favorites & caching policy. 

You can try the native demo on an Android device [here](https://www.codenameone.com/demos-PropertyCross.html) and also check out the live [in browser version of the demo](https://www.codenameone.com/demos/PropertyCross/). The latter uses the [Codename One JavaScript port](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/javascript-port.html) to build the unmodified demo into a web app.
